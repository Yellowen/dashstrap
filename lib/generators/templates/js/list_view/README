Steps to installation:

      0. You have to have a working model to use this scaffold. So create
         your model and setup validations, relations and other stuff.

      1. Add resource to routes.rb for example in case of `car` scaffold do:

           namespace :api, :defaults => {:format => :json} do
             namespace :v1 do
               resources :cars, :except => [:new]
             end
           end

      2. The Angularjs module of your resource should be added as an dependency
         to another Angularjs module. Add it by hand or if you want to view module
         in dashboard's main page add your resource to `config/initializers/faalis.rb`
         like this:

                config.dashboard_modules = {
                    :car => {
                       :icon => "fa fa-car",
                       :sidemenu => true,
                    },
                }

      3. Make sure that you have `api_controller.rb` in your `app/controllers` with this content:


              class APIController < Faalis::APIController
              end
